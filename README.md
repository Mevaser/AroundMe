# AroundMe

A website i set up during the first lockdown to show me where i can go.  
(In the first lockdown we could travel only 500m around the house.)

# Notes
- This was a couple hours project, I uploaded it now just to preserve the code.
- This is **really** bad code.
- I honestly don't know if this project runs. i previously directly ran it in a server.
